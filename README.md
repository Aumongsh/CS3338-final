## Important Message for Professor
Please use commit history to check our updates instead of the Snapshot Tags. We weren't very knowledgeable on how tagging worked and didn't realize it only points to a specific commit without the ability to push future commits to organize commits from different times and different members into individual Snapshots.

## Objective Breakdown
This Audience Analytics webapp is to compare the user's channel against another user-chosen channel. It will then go through a number of videos specified by the user and provide stats regarding the shared audience between the two channels.

## Significance and Goals
With content creation becoming more and more accessible, the number of aspiring content creators are constantly increasing.
However, it is common knowledge that growing a channel isn't exactly easy.
And so, the goal of this webapp is to provide newer content creators with a tool that can help them analyze their audience and provide insights on what kind of content their audience is interested in.
While the information provided may seem limited at first glance, the primary intention of the app is provide helpful information that the user can consider regarding their channel's content and growth without strictly suggesting any action they should take.
